# Who Touched My bible

This is a home project I am working on for my own personal interest.

## Things coming up

* Adding all of the KJV and KJV 1611 translations
* Requesting permission from some major translations with copyright
* Adding different lenses to view scripture through. These include cross-references, translation history, cultural context, design patterns, etc.
* Search by verses
* Individual word context

## Coding

I'm using f#, fable elmish, and various open source tools. I still need to do some optimization of the build structure, but for now it works.

## The Name

The name comes from a few questions.

* "Who all touched this translation thorughout history?"
* "My bible isn't where I left it. Who moved my bible?!"
* "What should I name this thing? Naming things is hard. "
