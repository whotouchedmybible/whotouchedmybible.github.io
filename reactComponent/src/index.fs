// End of boilerplate! Let's start defining our component

// This is the most verbose way to define a component but also the most flexible.

// If you expect the component to be consumed from javascript with JSX you can expose a bare function as a react component and that will work (including hooks).
// If you call this from F# it would act as a plain function so you would have to wrap it with FunctionComponent.Of (or `ofFunction`) if you need hooks to work.
